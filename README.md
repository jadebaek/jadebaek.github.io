# Jade Baek – Neuroscience + Lab Engineering Portfolio

👋 Hi, I’m Jade Baek – a neuroscience researcher and lab engineer with a passion for 3D printing, electronics, and building accessible scientific tools. I’m currently working on mouse addiction neuroscience experiments involving drug self-administration, head-fix setups, and advanced imaging.

🔧 This is a growing collection of my lab-built projects and hardware innovations.

## 🔬 Highlighted Projects

### 🧪 Modular Infusion Pump
**Timeline**: 2023  
Collaborated on designing and optimizing a lab-grade infusion pump for mouse self-administration experiments. Used Arduino for control logic, and custom circuit design to interface with lab behavior software.

> Reduced build costs by 90% compared to commercial pumps.

### 🛠️ Head-Fix Mouse Experiment Rig
**Timeline**: 2023  
Collaborated with postdocs to build a customizable head-fix setup for two-photon imaging and lever-based behavior. Designed brackets and surgical tools using Autodesk Tinkercad. Integrated with custom software (REACHER).

> Modular design allows reuse across multiple behavioral paradigms.
