# Seo Young "Jade" Baek: Neuroscience & Lab Engineering Portfolio
I am a neuroscience researcher and lab engineer who specializes in building accessible scientific tools. With a strong foundation in 3D printing and electronics, I focus on creating hardware solutions for euroscience experiments, including drug self-administration, head-fix setups, and advanced imaging.

This repository showcases a selection of lab-built projects and hardware innovations.

## 🔬 Highlighted Projects

### 🧪 Modular Infusion Pump
**Timeline**: 2023  
Collaborated on the design and optimization of a lab-grade infusion pump for mouse self-administration experiments. This project utilized Arduino for control logic and custom circuit design to interface with lab behavior software, successfully reducing build costs by 90% compared to commercial pumps.

### 🛠️ Head-Fix Mouse Experiment Rig
**Timeline**: 2023  
Partnered with post-doctoral researchers to build a customizable head-fix setup for two-photon imaging and lever-based behavior. The design included brackets and surgical tools created with Autodesk Tinkercad and was integrated with custom REACHER software. The modular design of this rig allows for reuse across multiple behavioral paradigms.

### 💡 Arduino-Controlled Behavioral Levers
**Timeline**: 2024  
Developed behavioral lever systems with adjustable tension sensors for self-administration models. The system uses an Arduino and breadboard circuitry to trigger reward delivery. This project is currently used across over four concurrent experiments in the lab. Jade also trained lab colleagues on its use and optimized its sensitivity.
